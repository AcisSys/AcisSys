- 👋 Hi, I’m @AcisSys or Ace
- 👀 I’m interested in both software and hardware, more leaning towards user-interactive projects.
          I develop a lot of different small projects / programs
             that come to my head, I make everything .
                    from small time countdown and textadventures in Python
                              to DataBase Managers and websites or even android Apps.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C#, HTML and Java
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Android Apps (Java) or small python projects
- 📫 I can be reached on alexfdias1801@gmail.com (checked every 15 days) or GodsFAVsimp#7257 (Discord, checked every day)
-     If you think you have a challenge I will find funny
